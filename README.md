# TourGuideApp

## Project name: Bhopal Darshan[^](https://github.com/RB-93/TourGuideApp/blob/master/README.md#legends)

## Description:

This project was created as a part of the Android Basics Nanodegree and for Google India Scholarship Challenge 2k18. The goal of this project is to create a Tour Guide App which presents relevant information to a user who’s visiting your city. The app can list top attractions, restaurants, public places, or events for the city.
* In this project, I have worked on showing famous attractions of the city [Bhopal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhopal) - _The City of Lakes_ is the capital city of the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh.

## Legends:

* ^The word is derived from the Sanskrit word darsana meaning “sight”, “vision”, or “appearance”.
  - Here it refers to the english word "vision" that means the act of going to see some person or place or thing for a short time.
